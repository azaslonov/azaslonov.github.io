## Highlights

- **Modern API documentation portal**. Create a modern API documentation portal with REST API reference pages, code samples, and interactive console. Customize it through a drag-and-drop, no-code visual editor.
- **GitHub-based API ecosystem**. Create a GitHub-based API ecosystem for communication and collaboration between API providers and API consumers. Track source code changes, automate portal deployments with GitHub Actions, and host the site for free with GitHub Pages.
- **Enterprise-wide API catalog**. Publish the portal within the organization to catalog APIs for discoverability, deduplication of assets, and business efficiency.
- **Branded API documentation portal**. Publish the branded portal to partners or external consumers for discoverability and self-onboarding.
- **Proven technology**. API documentation portal relies on the same technology as the Azure API Managementâ€™s developer portal ([documentation](https://aka.ms/apimdocs/portal), [GitHub](https://aka.ms/apimdevportal)), which is used by thousands of Microsoft Azure customers.
